# Quantum Sand Grains

A RubyGem for defining the interactions within Quantum Sand.

Individual lessons, talks and presentations are defined as grains.

The file format is JSON.

Alongside media resource files like video narrative, animated cartoons and videogames.

Quantum Sand grains each have their own unique repository.

Grains have their own Git distributed version control system (DVCS) that tracks changes in files over time.

This means that every iteration of grains are recorded in the history for each repository.

It is necessary to setup multiple Git remotes using two URLs.

Remote 1 is a (local for now) Gitea repository.

Remote 2 is the GitHub repository.

TODO: Push to multiple remotes.
