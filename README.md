# Quantum Sand

Quantum Sand is an everything app, including an educational art-game-storytelling platform. Written in React, Rust, Ruby-on-Rails, C++ and Qml. Blender is used for the artwork.

Quantum Sand is primarily Linux based but I would love to support Windows and macOS. The only blocker is the lack of Wayland compositor support within Qt on those platforms.

A special trick is used to embed Rust videogames into a hovering 3d surface. Until Windows and macOS support Wayland, Windows and macOS will be unable to run Quantum Sand correctly.
