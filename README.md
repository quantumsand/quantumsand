# Quantum Sand

Quantum Sand is an everything app, including an educational art-game-storytelling platform. Written in React, Rust, Ruby-on-Rails, C++ and Qml. Blender is used for the artwork.

Quantum Sand is primarily Linux based but I would love to support Windows and macOS. The only blocker is the lack of Wayland compositor support within Qt on those platforms.

A special trick is used to embed Rust videogames into a hovering 3d surface. Until Windows and macOS support Wayland, Windows and macOS will be unable to run Quantum Sand correctly.

## Storytelling

Within the storytelling of Quantum Sand, the main characters who teach Xenia and Andrew, are Chinese and Japanese.

The Chinese characters are Ai and Zhao.

The Japanese characters are Sakura and Akio.

This reflects a deep fascination with Chinese and Japanese storytelling and artwork over a long period.

Storytelling in videogames such as Ocarina of Time and Shenmue have left an impression that has lasted for decades.

## Target hardware

Target hardware for Quantum Sand:

* LimeSDR Mini 2.0
* An AMD Ryzen SBC
* An AI accelerator SBC (possibly an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, or a Chinese alternative).
* More to follow.

Note: The only blocker at present, is reliable Gentoo Linux support. The NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano is a favourite but Gentoo Linux is an unknown.
