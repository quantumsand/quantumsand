# Quantum Sand Geospatial Ads

Privacy-focused geospatial ads.

Only one set of adverts are displayed at any time.

Adverts are split into 180px by 180px square images with some optional text overlay.

Since only one set of adverts is displayed at once, we only need to know when the entire adverts component is clicked.

We do not need to log the individual advert tile that was clicked.
