# Quantum Sand Geospatial Ads

Privacy-focused geospatial ads.

Only one set of adverts are displayed at any time.

Adverts are split into 180px by 180px square images with some optional text overlay.

Since only one set of adverts are displayed at once, we only need to know when the entire adverts component is clicked.

We do not need to log the individual advert tile that was clicked.

For an advertising campaign, 4 or more advert tiles are recommended. Perhaps 4 to 8 advert tiles.

Clicking on the adverts component will load a more detailed business page.

Advertising campaigns and business pages will be defined as JSON within a Git repository using GeoJSON.
